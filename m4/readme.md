To run the pong game, put mqtt.ino on your Nano 33T IOT, and run pong_arduino.py on your laptop. Change the username and password in mqtt.ino to your WIFI networks password. 

Special thanks to Warren for providing his MQTT code for Python during discussion during Week 5. I starred and used this library for my wifi connection implementation. Here is the link to his repsitory: https://github.com/warrenwallis/ECEM119/tree/main/M2 .
